# Learning CPlusPlus for TouchDesigner
A repo to hold my exploration into the CPlusPlus operators in TouchDesigner.

## Usage
Clone or download the repo. Open the .sln files using Visual Studio. There are comments that walk through what is happening in each file. 
Look for the tag <<LearnC++>> for my comments and walkthroughs within the Derivative sample files. 

There are two .bat files which can be used on a Windows machine to enable and disable debugging.

More to come, so stay tuned!
