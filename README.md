# Learning CPlusPlus for TouchDesigner
A repo to hold my exploration into the CPlusPlus operators in TouchDesigner.

## Introduction 
I am going to take the time to learn the CPlusPlus TOPs and CHOPs in TouchDesigner.
My hope is to go through and make plain explanations of how the code is working in
each of these examples so you can follow along and learn how these complicated objects
work and how you can leverage them for your own systems.

I recommend starting with learning some basics about C++ and how the logic of the language
works. We won't be starting out with anything too complicated - however having a baseline 
understanding of C++ will be a huge benefit. Below are some helpful links:

Derivative has left a lot of useful comments in the code already. In order parse which 
comments are which - please look for the signature <<LearnC++>> on the first line of the 
comment.

Disclaimer: I am by no means an expert in C++ and will most likely make a few mistakes. 
If you notice any mistake please open an issue on GITHUB and I will correct it. I am doing
this mostly to fill in the gaps in my own knowledge.


## Usage
Clone or download the repo. Open the .sln files using Visual Studio. There are comments that walk through what is happening in each file. 

There are two .bat files which can be used on a Windows machine to enable and disable debugging.

More to come, so stay tuned!
